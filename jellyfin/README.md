## About

[jellyfin](https://jellyfin.media/) organizes video, music, live TV, and photos from personal media libraries and streams them to smart TVs, streaming boxes and mobile devices. This container is packaged as a standalone jellyfin Media Server.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-jellyfin) from linuxserver.io.

## Configuration

### Addon config

Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:8096`.

```yaml
PGID: user
GPID: user
TZ: timezone
localdisks: sda1 #put the hardware name of your drive to mount separated by commas, or its label. ex. sda1, sdb1, MYNAS...
networkdisks: "//SERVER/SHARE" # optional, list of smb servers to mount, separated by commas
cifsusername: "username" # optional, smb username, same for all smb shares
cifspassword: "password" # optional, smb password
cifsdomain: "domain" # optional, allow setting the domain for the smb share
DOCKER_MODS: linuxserver/mods:jellyfin-opencl-intel|linuxserver/mods:jellyfin-amd|linuxserver/mods:jellyfin-rffmpeg # Install graphic drivers
```

### Enable ssl
#### Creating the PFX certificate file first
1. This part assumes you already have SSL certs in PEM format using the Let's Encrypt add on
2. Run this command `openssl pkcs12 -export -in fullchain.pem -inkey private_key.pem -passout pass: -out server.pfx`
3. Set the permission using `chmod 0700 server.pfx`
> Note:
> The above command creates a PFX file without a password, you can fill in a password with `-passout pass:"your-password"`
> but will also have to provide `your-password` to Jellyfin's configuration

#### Automating the PFX certificate

#### Jellyfin configuration
1. From the sidebar, click on `Administration` -> `Dashboard`
2. Under `Networking`, `Server Address Settings`, tick `Enable HTTPS`
3. Under `HTTPS Settings`, tick `Require HTTPS`
4. For `Custom SSL certificate path:`, point it to your PFX file and fill in the `Certificate password` if required
5. Scroll to the bottom and `Save`
