## About

["Firefly III"](https://www.firefly-iii.org) is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more.
This addon is based on the docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/fireflyiii/core

PLEASE CHANGE YOUR APP_KEY BEFORE FIRST LAUNCH! YOU WON'T BE ABLE AFTERWRADS WITHOUT RESETTING YOUR DATABASE.

- Addon options

```yaml
"CONFIG_LOCATION": location of the config.yaml # Sets the location of the config.yaml (see below)
"DB_CONNECTION": "list(sqlite_internal|mariadb_addon|mysql|pgsql)" # Defines the type of database to use : sqlite (default, embedded in the addon) ; MariaDB (auto-detection if the MariaDB addon is installed and runs), and external databases that requires that the other DB_ fields are set (mysql and pgsql)
"APP_KEY": 12 characters # This is your encryption key, don't lose it!
"DB_HOST": "CHANGEME" # only needed if using a remote database
"DB_PORT": "CHANGEME" # only needed if using a remote database
