## About

Network presence and intruder detector. Scans for devices connected to your network and alerts you if new and unknown devices are found.
This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/tree/main/dockerfiles) from jokob-sk.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Carefully configure the add-on to your preferences, see the official documentation for for that.

## Configuration

1. If unavailable, the app generates a default `app.conf` and `app.db` file on the first run.
1. The preferred way is to manage the configuration via the Settings section in the UI, if UI is inaccessible you can modify `app.conf` in the `/app/config/` folder directly.
1. You have to specify which network(s) should be scanned. This is done by entering subnets that are accessible from the host. If you use the default `ARPSCAN` plugin, you have to specify at least one valid subnet and interface in the `SCAN_SUBNETS` setting. See the [documentation on How to set up multiple SUBNETS, VLANs and what are limitations](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/docs/SUBNETS.md) and for troubleshooting and more advanced scenarios.
1. Read how to get devices into your [Home Assistant instance via the MQTT plugin](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/docs/HOME_ASSISTANT.md)
1. Back everything up by following the [Backups documentation](https://github.com/jokob-sk/NetAlertX/blob/main/docs/BACKUPS.md).
