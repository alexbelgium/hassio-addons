## Using Photoprism Command-Line Interface

Photoprism also provides a command line interface:

https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/docker-compose/#command-line-interface

You can access it via portainer addon or executing `docker exec -it <photoprism container id> bash` via _ssh_.

:warning: Do not use `docker exec <photoprism container id> photoprism` as this will lead to unpredictable behavior.
