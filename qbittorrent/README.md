## About

---

[Qbittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) is a cross-platform free and open-source BitTorrent client.
This addon is based on the docker image from [linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/).

This addons has several configurable options :

- allowing to mount local external drive, or smb share from the addon
- [alternative webUI](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/List-of-known-alternate-WebUIs)
- usage of ssl
- ingress
- optional openvpn support
- allow setting specific DNS servers

## Configuration

---

Webui can be found at <http://your-ip:8080>, or in your sidebar using Ingress.
The default username/password : described in the startup log.
Configurations can be done through the app webUI, except for the following options

Network disk is mounted to /mnt/share name

You need to map the exposed port in your router if you want the best speed and connectivity.

```yaml
PGID: user
GPID: user
ssl: true/false
certfile: fullchain.pem #ssl certificate, must be located in /ssl
keyfile: privkey.pem #sslkeyfile, must be located in /ssl
whitelist: "localhost,192.168.0.0/16" # list ip subnets that won't need a password (optional)
customUI: selection from list # alternative webUI can be set here. Latest version set at each addon start. Select 'custom' to fill it yourself in the webui
DNS_servers: 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1 # Keep blank to use routerâ€™s DNS, or set custom DNS to avoid spamming in case of local DNS ad-remover
SavePath: "/share/qbittorrent" # Define the download directory
localdisks: sda1 #put the hardware name of your drive to mount separated by commas, or its label. ex. sda1, sdb1, MYNAS...
networkdisks: "//SERVER/SHARE" # optional, list of smb servers to mount, separated by commas
cifsusername: "username" # optional, smb username, same for all smb shares
cifspassword: "password" # optional, smb password
cifsdomain: "domain" # optional, allow setting the domain for the smb share
openvpn_enabled: true/false # is openvpn required to start qbittorrent
openvpn_config": For example "config.ovpn" # name of the file located in /config/openvpn.
openvpn_username": USERNAME
openvpn_password: YOURPASSWORD
openvpn_alt_mode: bind at container level and not app level
run_duration: 12h #for how long should the addon run. Must be formatted as number + time unit (ex : 5s, or 2m, or 12h, or 5d...)
silent: true #suppresses debug messages
```

## Installation

---

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other add-on.

1. Add my add-ons repository to your home assistant instance (in supervisor addons store at top right, or click button below if you have configured my HA)
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Falexbelgium%2Fhassio-addons)
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Set the add-on options to your preferences
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Open the webUI and adapt the software options

## Integration with HA

Use the [qBittorrent integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/qbittorrent/)

You can use the following snippets to check and set the alternate speeds (the HA integration above is not needed for this)

```bash
shell_command:
  toggle_torrent_speed: curl -X POST https://<YOUR HA IP>:8081/api/v2/transfer/toggleSpeedLimitsMode -k
sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    name: get_torrent_speed
    command: curl https://<YOUR HA IP>:8081/api/v2/transfer/speedLimitsMode -k
```

If you're not using the SSL option, you can skip the -k parameter and use http instead of https in the URL

These lines will expose a `sensor.get_torrent_speed` that updates every 60 seconds and returns 1 if the alternate speed mode is enabled, 0 otherwise, and a `shell_command.toggle_torrent_speed` that you can call as a Service in your automations
