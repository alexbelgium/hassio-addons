TZ: Europe/London #Specify a timezone to use EG Europe/London.
PMM_CONFIG: /config/addons_config/plex-data-manager/config/config.yml #Specify a custom config file to use.
PMM_TIME: 03:00 #Comma-separated list of times to update each day. Format: HH:MM.

PMM_TEST: False #Set to True to run in debug mode with only collections that have test: true.
PMM_NO_MISSING: False #Set to True to run without any of the missing movie/show functions.
```

- Config.yaml (advanced usage)
