# Home assistant add-on: overseerr

## 💖 Support development

I maintain this and other Home Assistant add-ons in my free time: keeping up with upstream changes, HA changes, and testing on real hardware takes a lot of time (and some money). I use around 5-10 of my >110 addons so regularly I install test machines (and purchase some test services such as vpn) that I don't use myself to troubleshoot and improve the addons

If this add-on saves you time or makes your setup easier, I would be very grateful for your support and appreciation!
