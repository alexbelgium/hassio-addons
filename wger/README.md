## About

[wger](https://github.com/wger-project/wger) Workout Manager is a free, open source web application that helps you manage your personal workouts, weight and diet plans and can also be used as a simple gym management utility. It offers a REST API as well, for easy integration with other projects and tools.

## Configuration

- Start the addon. Wait a while and check the log for any errors.
- Open yourdomain.com:8000 (where ":8000" is the port configured in the addon).
- Default
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `adminadmin`

Options can be configured through two ways :

- Addon options

```yaml
"CONFIG_LOCATION": location of the config.yaml # Sets the location of the config.yaml (see below)
```

- Config.yaml

Additional variables can be set as ENV variables by adding them in the config.yaml in the location defined in your addon options

The complete list of ENV variables can be seen here : not available
