## About

[wger](https://github.com/wger-project/wger) Workout Manager is a free, open source web application that helps you manage your personal workouts, weight and diet plans and can also be used as a simple gym management utility. It offers a REST API as well, for easy integration with other projects and tools.

## Configuration

- Start the addon. Wait a while and check the log for any errors. Initial start can take up to 15 minutes !
- Open yourdomain.com:8000 (where ":8000" is the port configured in the addon).
- Default
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `adminadmin`

Options can be configured through two ways :

- Addon options

```yaml
"CONFIG_LOCATION": location of the config.yaml # Sets the location of the config.yaml (see below)
```

- Config.yaml (advanced usage)

Additional variables can be set as ENV variables by adding them in the config.yaml in the location defined in your addon options according to this guide : https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Add%E2%80%90ons-feature-:-add-env-variables
