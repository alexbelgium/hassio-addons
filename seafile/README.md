PASSWORD: Optionally set a password for the gui
CLI_ARGS: Optionally pass cli start arguments to seafile
localdisks: sda1 #put the hardware name of your drive to mount separated by commas, or its label. ex. sda1, sdb1, MYNAS...
networkdisks: "//SERVER/SHARE" # optional, list of smb servers to mount, separated by commas
cifsusername: "username" # optional, smb username, same for all smb shares
cifspassword: "password" # optional, smb password
force_scheme_https: if you have issues accessing ingress with https, check this box to force https
