# Home assistant add-on: code-server

# ⚠️ It is recommended to use the official addon (https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-vscode) instead of this fork. The only benefit of this fork is automated releases, now implemented in the offical one. ⚠️

## 💖 Support development

I maintain this and other Home Assistant add-ons in my free time: keeping up with Immich changes, HA changes, and testing on real hardware takes a lot of time (and some money).

If this add-on saves you time or makes your setup easier, you can support my work here:
