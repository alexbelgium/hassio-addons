## About

Web-based file management interface that provides a secure way to browse, upload, download, edit and manage files on your Home Assistant system. Filebrowser offers a clean, modern interface for handling your files through a web browser, with support for multiple file formats, preview capabilities, and comprehensive file operations.

This addon is based on the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser) from the official Filebrowser project.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. [Add my Home Assistant add-ons repository][repository] to your Home Assistant instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Access the web UI through the sidebar or at `<your-ip>:8071`.

## Configuration

The web UI can be found at `<your-ip>:8071` or through the Home Assistant sidebar when using Ingress.

**Default credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

**Important:** Change the default credentials immediately after first login for security.

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |

| `ssl` | bool | `false` | Enable HTTPS for web interface |
| `certfile` | str | `fullchain.pem` | SSL certificate file (in `/ssl/`) |
| `keyfile` | str | `privkey.pem` | SSL private key file (in `/ssl/`) |
| `NoAuth` | bool | `true` | Disable authentication (resets database when changed) |
| `disable_thumbnails` | bool | `true` | Disable thumbnail generation for improved performance |
| `base_folder` | str | _(optional)_ | Root folder for file browser (defaults to all mapped folders) |
| `localdisks` | str | _(optional)_ | Local drives to mount (e.g., `sda1,sdb1,MYNAS`) |
| `networkdisks` | str | _(optional)_ | SMB shares to mount (e.g., `//SERVER/SHARE`) |
| `cifsusername` | str | _(optional)_ | SMB username for network shares |
| `cifspassword` | str | _(optional)_ | SMB password for network shares |
| `cifsdomain` | str | _(optional)_ | SMB domain for network shares |

```

## Setup

1. Start the add-on and wait for it to initialize.
1. Access the web interface through the Home Assistant sidebar or at `<your-ip>:8071`.
1. Log in using the default credentials:
