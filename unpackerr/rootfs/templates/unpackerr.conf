# [true/false] Turn on debug messages in the output. Do not wrap this in quotes.
# Recommend trying this so you know what it looks like. I personally leave it on.
debug = false

# Disable writing messages to stdout. This silences the app. You should set a log
# file below if you set this to true. Recommended when starting with systemctl.
quiet = false

# Setting activity to true will silence all app queue log lines with only zeros.
# Set this to true when you want less log spam.

# Default is a minute. 2m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h are also perfectly acceptable.

# Write messages to a log file. This is the same data that is normally output to stdout.
# This setting is great for Docker users that want to export their logs to a file.
# The alternative is to use syslog to log the output of the application to a file.
# Default is no log file; this is unset. log_files=0 turns off auto-rotation.
# Default files is 10 and size(mb) is 10 Megabytes; both doubled if debug is true.
# Windows paths must use two backslashes: "C:\\Some\\Path\\Unpacker.log" (true everywhere).

# How often to poll sonarr and radarr.
# Recommend 1m-5m. Uses Go Duration.

# How long an item must be queued (download complete) before extraction will start.
# One minute is the historic default and works well. Set higher if your downloads
# take longer to finalize (or transfer locally). Uses Go Duration.

# How long to wait before removing the history for a failed extraction.
# Once the history is deleted the item will be recognized as new and
# extraction will start again. Uses Go Duration.

# How many files may be extracted in parallel. 1 works fine.
# Do not wrap the number in quotes. Raise this only if you have fast disks and CPU.

# Use these configurations to control the file modes used for newly extracted
# files and folders. Recommend 0644/0755 or 0666/0777.

# Sends a webhook when an extraction queues, starts, finishes, and/or is deleted.
# Created to integrate with notifiarr.com.
# Also works natively with Discord.com, Telegram.org, and Slack.com webhooks.
# Can possibly be used with other services by providing a custom template_path.
###### Don't forget to uncomment [[webhook]] and url at a minimum !!!!
