## About

---
Extract from the author's gighub :
[unpackerr](https://github.com/unpackerr/unpackerr) runs as a daemon on your download host. It checks for completed downloads and extracts them so Lidarr, Radarr, Readarr, Sonarr may import them. There are a handful of options out there for extracting and deleting files after your client downloads them.

This addon is based on the docker image https://hub.docker.com/r/hotio/unpackerr

Unpackerr monitors completed downloads and extracts archives automatically.

### Setup Steps

3. Configure *arr apps to monitor the watch path for imports
4. Start the addon and monitor logs for activity
