This guide provides instructions on how to install and run the BattybirdNET-Pi container using Docker Compose without dependency on HomeAssistant.

_Note : For usage as an HomeAssistant addon, see [here](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/blob/master/battybirdnet-pi/README.md)_

Thanks to @gotschi for the initial Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Installation

1. **Create a directory for BattybirdNET-Pi**

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/battybirdnet-pi && cd ~/battybirdnet-pi
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**
   Create and open the file with:

   ```sh
   nano docker-compose.yml
   ```

   Copy and paste the following configuration:

   ```yaml
   services:
     battybirdnet-pi:
       container_name: battybirdnet-pi
       image: ghcr.io/alexbelgium/battybirdnet-pi-amd64:latest # or ghcr.io/alexbelgium/battybirdnet-pi-aarch64:latest depending on your system
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - "8001:8081" # Used to access WebUI
         - "80:80" # Optional: set to 80 to use Caddy's automatic SSL. Can otherwise be set to null to avoid opening an additional port
       environment:
         - TZ=Europe/Vienna # Optional: Set your timezone according to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
         - BIRDSONGS_FOLDER=/config/BirdSongs # Folder to store bird songs, be sure to use a path that is mapped to a volume (such as /config)
         - LIVESTREAM_BOOT_ENABLED=false # Enable/disable livestream on boot
         - ssl=false # Enable/disable SSL
         - certfile=fullchain.pem # SSL certificate file (located in /ssl/)
         - keyfile=privkey.pem # SSL key file (located in /ssl/)
         - pi_password= # Optional: Set SSH user password
         - MQTT_HOST_manual= # Optional: Manual MQTT host
         - MQTT_PASSWORD_manual= # Optional: Manual MQTT password
         - MQTT_PORT_manual= # Optional: Manual MQTT port
         - MQTT_USER_manual= # Optional: Manual MQTT user
       volumes:
         - ./config:/config # All your configuration files - and location of the default Birdsongs folder
         - ./ssl:/ssl # SSL certificates
         - /dev/shm:/dev/shm # Shared memory
       tmpfs:
         - /tmp # Optional
   ```

3. **Start the Container**
   Run the following command in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This will start the BattybirdNET-Pi container in detached mode.

4. **Access BattybirdNET-Pi Web UI**
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```sh
   http://localhost:8001 # Or whatever port you have configured
   ```
   Replace `localhost` with your server's IP address if running on another machine.

## troubleshoot

If rtsp feed doesn't work, perhaps you need to add "-rtsp-transport tcp" to your ffmpeg instruction, or allow udp on your network

## Updating to the Latest Version

To check for new versions of the container and update:

1. **Check for the latest version**
   Visit the container registry:
   [https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/pkgs/container/battybirdnet-pi-amd64](https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/pkgs/container/battybirdnet-pi-amd64)

   The latest version tag (e.g., `2025.02.23`) will be listed.

2. **Update and restart the container**
   Run the following commands:

   ```sh
   docker compose pull battybirdnet-pi
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

   This pulls the latest image and restarts the container.

3. **Verify the update**
   ```sh
   docker images | grep battybirdnet-pi
   ```
   This will show the latest downloaded image version.

## Stopping and Removing the Container

To stop and remove the container, run:

```sh
docker compose down
```

This will stop and remove BattybirdNET-Pi while keeping the configuration and recorded songs intact.
