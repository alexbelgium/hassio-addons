## About

Transmission is a bittorrent client.
This addon is based on the [docker image](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-transmission) from linuxserver.io.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Carefully configure the add-on to your preferences, see the official documentation for for that.

## Configuration

Options :

```yaml
download_dir: "/share/downloads" # where the files will be saved after download
incomplete_dir: "/share/incomplete" # where the files are saved during download
localdisks: sda1 #put the hardware name of your drive to mount separated by commas, or its label. ex. sda1, sdb1, MYNAS...
networkdisks: "<//SERVER/SHARE>" # list of smbv2/3 servers to mount, '' if none
cifsusername: "<username>" # smb username
cifspassword: "<password>" # smb password
```

Complete transmission options are in /share/transmission (make sure addon is stopped before modifying it as Transmission writes its ongoing values when stopping and could erase your changes)

Webui can be found at `<your-ip>:9091`.
