## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add my Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.
1. Carefully configure the add-on to your preferences, see the official documentation for for that.

Beware that you need to install a separate postgres addon to be able to connect the database. You can install the postgres addon already in my repository.
Beware to change the password BEFORE starting it ; it won't change afterwards
