## 3.2.2.5080-7 (03-01-2022)
- Cleanup: config base folder changed to /config/addons_config (thanks @bruvv)
- New standardized logic for Dockerfile build and packages installation
- Allow mounting local drives by label. Just pust the label instead of sda1 for example
- Improve SMB mount code to v1.5 ; accepts several network disks separated by commas (//123.12.12.12/share,//123.12.12.12/hello) that are mount to /mnt/$sharename
- Breaking changes : multiple network disks must be separated by a "," and they are mounted to a folder with the name of the external share.
