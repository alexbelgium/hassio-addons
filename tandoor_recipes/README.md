## About

[Tandoor recipes](https://github.com/TandoorRecipes/recipes), made by [vabene1111](https://github.com/vabene1111) is meant for people with a collection of recipes they want to share with family and friends or simply store them in a nicely organized way. A basic permission system exists but this application is not meant to be run as a public page.

## Configuration

Please check Tandoor Recipes documentation : https://docs.tandoor.dev/install/docker/

```yaml
Required :
    "ALLOWED_HOSTS": "your system url", # You need to input your homeassistant urls (comma separated, without space) to allow ingress to work
    "DB_TYPE": "list(sqlite|postgresql_external)" # Type of database to use.
    "SECRET_KEY": "str", # Your secret key
    "PORT": 9928 # By default, the webui is available on http://HAurl:9928. If you ever need to change the port, you should never do it within the app, but only through this option
    "Environment": 0|1 # 1 is debug mode, 0 is normal mode. You should run in normal mode unless actively developing.
Optional :
    "POSTGRES_HOST": "str?", # Needed for postgresql_external
    "POSTGRES_PORT": "str?", # Needed for postgresql_external
    "POSTGRES_USER": "str?", # Needed for postgresql_external
    "POSTGRES_PASSWORD": "str?", # Needed for postgresql_external
    "POSTGRES_DB": "str?" # Needed for postgresql_external
```
