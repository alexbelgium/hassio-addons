## About

[webtop](https://github.com/webtop/webtop) is a full desktop environments accessible via any modern web browser.
This addon is based on the docker image https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-webtop

## Configuration

Webui can be found with ingress or at <http://homeassistant:PORT>. The port is by default disabled but can be enabled through the addon options.

By default the image is based around the abc user and we recommend using this user as all of the init/config is based around it. The default password is also abc . If you want to change this password and require authentication when accessing the interface simply issue passwd inside a gui terminal in the webtop. Then when accessing the web interface use the path:

http://localhost:3000/?login=true

Apps installations are not remanent, you need to do it via addon options. Their config, however, is.

If graphics don't work, use the DRINODE feature to select your graphic device.

See all potential ENV variables here : https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-webtop#optional-environment-variables

```yaml
TZ: timezone ; Country/City according to https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man3/DateTime::TimeZone::Catalog.3pm.html
additional_apps: engrampa,thunderbird # Allows installation of apps, as they are not persistent
DRINODE: specify a custom graphic device, default is /dev/dri/renderD128
DNS_servers: 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1 # Keep blank to use routerâ€™s DNS, or set custom DNS to avoid spamming in case of local DNS ad-remover
localdisks: sda1 # Local drives to mount (e.g., `sda1,sdb1,MYNAS`)
networkdisks: "//SERVER/SHARE" # SMB shares to mount (e.g., `//SERVER/SHARE`)
