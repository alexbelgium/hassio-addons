    resource: "http://###.###.#.#:9090/api/groups/mealplans/today"
    method: GET
    name: Mealie todays meal
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer <put  auth here>
    value_template: "{{ value_json.value }}"
    json_attributes_path: $..recipe
    json_attributes:

      - id
      - totalTime
      - prepTime

  unique_id: sensor.TodaysDinner
  state: "{{ state_attr('sensor.mealie_todays_meal', 'name') }}"
- name: TodaysDinnerDescription
  unique_id: sensor.DinnerDescription
