# Home assistant add-on: Vaultwarden (Bitwarden RS)

Use the add-on `env_vars` option to pass extra environment variables (uppercase or lowercase names). See https://github.com/alexbelgium/hassio-addons/wiki/Add-Environment-variables-to-your-Addon-2 for details.

# ⚠️ It is recommended to use the official addon (https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-bitwarden) instead of this fork. The only benefit of this fork is automated releases, now implemented in the offical one. ⚠️

## 💖 Support development

I maintain this and other Home Assistant add-ons in my free time: keeping up with upstream changes, HA changes, and testing on real hardware takes a lot of time (and some money). I use around 5 or my >110 addons so usually I install test machines (and purchase some test services such as vpn) that I don't use myself to better support users

If this add-on saves you time or makes your setup easier, I would be very grateful for your support !
